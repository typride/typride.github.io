# Coding with Agents at Scale: Keeping the AI 'On Rails'

## 🧵 TL;DR

Managing a large codebase with AI agents (like in Cursor) is powerful — but only if you give your AI clear tracks to run on. I use planner/executor separation, contextual rules, changelogs, and scratchpads to ensure agents stay aligned with my intentions. Think of your codebase like a railway system: agents are fast trains, but they still need tracks, signals, and maps.

When your codebase starts sprawling across multiple layers — frontend, backend, database, CI/CD — bringing AI into your development flow can feel like inviting a hyper-intelligent intern into a filing cabinet on fire. Without structure, documentation, and rules, even the best agents will derail.

That’s why, over the past month, I’ve worked to make my system not just AI-friendly, but AI-guided. Using Cursor, agents, and a few battle-hardened strategies, I’ve created a development workflow that’s not only scalable, but legible to intelligent tools.

Here’s how I keep my AI coding experience “on rails.”

## 🚆 The Metaphor: Coding at Scale Is a Train System

Think of your development workflow like a railway network:

- **The AI agent** is your high-speed train — powerful, capable, but needs structure.
- **Your codebase** is the terrain — sprawling, layered, sometimes undocumented.
- **Rules, context, and changelogs** are the tracks and signals — they guide the agent.
- **Scratchpads and planners** are dispatch stations — they direct traffic and retain memory.

If the rails are broken or missing, your train crashes. If the stations don't coordinate, your trains collide. That’s why structure matters.

## 🧠 Core Agentic Practices I Use in Cursor

### 1. Planner + Executor Roles

Instead of expecting a single agent to do everything, I break it up:
- **Planner** defines the goal and the plan.
- **Executor** handles atomic actions with guardrails.

This separation lets me give focused context and keeps the AI from going rogue.

### 2. Contextual Cursor Rules

I define per-directory rules that explain:
- The purpose of the folder
- When files should be updated
- What the agent should *not* change

It’s like writing a mini `README.md` that trains the agent on your conventions.

### 3. Changelog Discipline

Every time a significant change is made:
- I update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- I include version numbers, dates, and summaries
- I link back to scratchpads or rules

This provides a historical trail that AI agents (and future me) can follow.

### 4. Scratchpads for Every Initiative

Each major effort gets a scratchpad that includes:
- A clear goal
- Problems being solved
- Step-by-step plan
- Lessons learned

It keeps Cursor agents (and me) aware of the full context over time.

### 5. Executable Documentation

When I update the API or SQL schema, I regenerate:
- `SCHEMA_OVERVIEW.mdx`
- `STACK_FLOW.mdx`
- `EXECUTION_TRACE.mdx`

This keeps the architecture legible to agents. I even use LLMs to generate Mermaid diagrams from my schema.

## 🤖🧠 Agentic Project Execution Flow (With Human Involvement Points)

### 📈 Flow Diagram

```
[1] Define Initiative
   |
   |-- 🧠 Human: Writes goal + scratchpad
   v
[2] Planner Agent
   |
   |-- Outputs a step-by-step task list
   |-- 🧠 Human: Reviews and edits plan
   v
[3] Context Injection
   |
   |-- Uses changelogs, schema docs, rules, etc.
   |-- 🧠 Human: Ensures docs/rules are accurate
   v
[4] Executor Agent
   |
   |-- Handles single task (e.g., update route, refactor module)
   |-- Logs changes, updates changelog
   |-- 🧠 Human: Reviews PR or code change
   v
[5] Testing + Observability
   |
   |-- Agent writes/updates tests
   |-- Agent traces data flow
   |-- 🧠 Human: Confirms metrics, validates side effects
   v
[6] Documentation + Diagrams
   |
   |-- Agent generates Mermaid / ER diagrams
   |-- 🧠 Human: Publishes or revises for clarity
   v
[7] Deployment or Next Step
   |
   |-- Agent proposes next task from plan
   |-- 🧠 Human: Decides whether to continue, pivot, or pause
```

| Stage                  | Human Role                                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Initiative Definition  | Write scratchpad, define goals                  |
| Plan Review            | Validate or edit agent-generated steps          |
| Context Curation       | Keep changelogs, rules, docs accurate           |
| Code Review            | Review AI-generated code before merge           |
| Impact Validation      | Validate behavior, performance, side effects    |
| Documentation Review   | Final pass on AI-generated docs or diagrams     |
| Strategy + Direction   | Prioritize roadmap, resolve ambiguity           |

## 🧪 What This Enables

With these systems in place, I can:
- Ask agents to trace data flow from frontend → backend → DB
- Refactor with confidence across multiple layers
- Auto-document as I go
- Catch performance bottlenecks by correlating logs

It’s not just helpful — it’s **agent-ready engineering.**

---

## 🧩 Lessons Learned

1. **Agents are powerful, not magical.** They need structure, just like junior devs.
2. **Scratchpads are underrated.** They’re memory for both you *and* your agents.
3. **Documentation isn’t overhead — it’s fuel.** Especially for AI.
4. **Start small, scale smart.** Add one rule, one changelog, one scratchpad — then build from there.

## 📊 Bonus: LinkedIn Poll

To go with the public post, I asked:

> "What’s the hardest part of managing AI agents in a large codebase?"

Top answers:
- Giving agents the right context
- Avoiding hallucinations and mistakes
- Trusting AI with critical changes

This confirmed what I’ve been learning firsthand: **context is everything.**

## Final Thoughts

Agentic coding isn’t about replacing devs — it’s about **augmenting them**. But just like humans, AI performs best with structure, feedback, and clarity.

If you treat your codebase like a railway system and your AI like a train that needs rails — you’ll build systems that are fast, safe, and scalable.
